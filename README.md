# Program for Testing & Analysis - README
This program is a GUI-based application designed using QT framework in Python for testing and analyzing bike parameters. It allows users to input bike parameters such as speed, distance traveled, battery levels before and after the ride, average, time, and more. The program records each entry based on the date and time of the input. The recorded data can be analyzed to calculate various metrics, such as the best riding speed for range, optimal riding speed, range attained when riding at high speed, and other similar parameters.
